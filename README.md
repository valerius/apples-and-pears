# README

## Why was this repo created?

To show you, in the most simple way, how Pundit works.

## How does Pundit work?

Check out commit https://github.com/valerius/apples-and-pears/commit/7398d5e704e079ce66d733082fffa8873c45efbe.

You essentially define policies (what actions can I perform?) and scopes (What records can I see?) for each model. Each resource/model/service/"thing" you have constructed a controller around should have its own Policy class.
